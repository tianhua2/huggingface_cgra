# Idefics3

## Overview

The Idefics3 model was proposed in [<INSERT PAPER NAME HERE>](<INSERT PAPER LINK HERE>) by <INSERT AUTHORS HERE>.

Idefics3 is an adaptation of the Idefics2 model with three main differences: 
- the use of Llama3 for the text model
- an updated processing logic for the images.
- The removal of the perceiver. 

The resolutions of input images can be directly controlled, and they are decomposed into
patches, or not, depending on the resolution. See [Idefics2] for more details on the model architecture.

The abstract from the paper is the following:
